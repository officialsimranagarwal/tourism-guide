Tourism Guide app 
The tourist guide application enables users to locate distinct places to visit. They get a detailed description of the site along with the nearby places that they can see. Using this application, the user can select a location to see and get all information regarding that place.

Whether it’s bus stations, restaurants, hotel rooms, famous places, or the site’s history, all you can get in the same place. The Android Tourist Guide App design is entirely interactive and smooth and allows the user to figure out things quickly.
